## What's System Scan?

> The name "System Scan" came from "とある科学の超電磁砲", Japanese animation. In that anime, most students have psychics and their abilities are graded in the special examination system, "System Scan." (see [Wikipedia](http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%A8%E3%81%82%E3%82%8B%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%A6%E3%81%AE%E8%B6%85%E9%9B%BB%E7%A3%81%E7%A0%B2) for more information.)
